This repository contains the code for my Smart Mirror project, built using the [MagicMirror²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) github repository. This smart mirror displays various modules such as calendar, Gmail feed, Compliments, Weather (in my area), Pollen count (in my area), news feed, tweets, and is Alexa control-able.

Features

- Calendar: Displays events using the Google Calendar API.
- Gmail Feed: Shows the latest unread emails from my Gmail account.
- Compliments: Shows me daily compliments.
- Weather: Displays current weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API keys.
- Pollen Count: Shows current pollen count in your local area.
- News Feed: Displays the latest news headlines.
- Tweets: Shows tweets using the Twitter API.
- Alexa Control: Allows control of modules using Alexa (shows different modules in different positions depending on the different modes).

The frame was built using some wood stained 4 by 2's and there is a 30% reflective plastic as a screen to cover the monitor. Behind the plastic screen is a monitor conencted to a raspberry pi. The plastic allows the light produced from the monitor to pass through while the rest of the surface acts as a mirror.

Below is a screenshot of my smart mirror in use. You can see the various modules displaying real-time information including the calendar, weather, news feed, and more. This visual representation gives a clear overview of how the smart mirror interfaces with the user and can streamline their day plan.

Demo Video

In this video, you can see a live demo of the smart mirror in action. I am using Alexa to interact with the mirror, showcasing how you can change the modules displayed on the screen using voice commands. This demo helps to show the seamless integration and functionality of Alexa with the smart mirror.
